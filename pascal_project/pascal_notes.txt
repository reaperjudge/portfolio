"high-level procedural programming language"
must declare variables above call (like both python & java)
main begin & end block is last
uses directives as settings (like assembly)
procedures in pascal don't have outputs
functions do have outputs and have to be part of their declarations
class methods and have to be initialized and declared separately
"createstr :=  var" is how to return from createstr
